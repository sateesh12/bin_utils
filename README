The different files and their purpose of existence is as follows in Alphabetical order.

1.AQI_Analysis.ipynb = This does linear regression model development for the Air Quality Index data-set

2.Automtobile_EDA.ipynb = This is an example of EDA analysis for the Automobile data-set, the data set can be found as Autombile_data.txt

3. DT_Abelone_Gender_Prediction.ipynb = Decision Tree model for the Gender prediction of Classification problem.

4. Iris.ipynb = Another Linear Regression model to predict the Sepal Length with the Iris data-set

5. Logistics_Regression.ipynb = A logistic linear regression for Gender prediction.

6. Random_Forest_Abelone_Gender_Prediction.ipynb = A logistic regression model for Gender predecition but using Random Forest.


Other Utility files:
1. snapshot.py = A small Python code to capcture screen shots from meetings without having to manually  print screen, copy to image file.
